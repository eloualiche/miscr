\title{Add rows corresponding to gaps in some variable}
\usage{
fill_gap(x, ..., along_with, by = NULL, full = FALSE, roll = FALSE,
  rollends = if (roll == "nearest") c(TRUE, TRUE) else if (roll >= 0) c(FALSE,
  TRUE) else c(TRUE, FALSE), units = NULL)

fill_gap_(x, vars, along_with, by = NULL, full = FALSE, roll = FALSE,
  rollends = if (roll == "nearest") c(TRUE, TRUE) else if (roll >= 0) c(FALSE,
  TRUE) else c(TRUE, FALSE), units = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.table}

\item{...}{Variables to keep (beyond the by and along_with variable). Default to all variables. See the \link[dplyr]{select} documentation.}

\item{along_with}{Numeric variable along which gaps should be filled. Default to last key. ee the \link[dplyr]{select} documentation.}

\item{by}{Variables by which to group. Default to keys (or to keys minus last if along_with is unspecified). ee the \link[dplyr]{select} documentation.}

\item{full}{A boolean. When full = FALSE (default) rows are filled with respect to min and max of \code{...} within each group. When full = TRUE, rows are filled with respect to min and max of \code{...} in the whole datasets.}

\item{roll}{When roll is a positive number, this limits how far values are carried forward. roll=TRUE is equivalent to roll=+Inf. When roll is a negative number, values are rolled backwards; i.e., next observation carried backwards (NOCB). Use -Inf for unlimited roll back. When roll is "nearest", the nearest value is used.}

\item{rollends}{A logical vector length 2 (a single logical is recycled). When rolling forward (e.g. roll=TRUE) if a value is past the last observation within each group defined by the join columns, rollends[2]=TRUE will roll the last value forwards. rollends[1]=TRUE will roll the first value backwards if the value is before it. If rollends=FALSE the value of i must fall in a gap in x but not after the end or before the beginning of the data, for that group defined by all but the last join column. When roll is a finite number, that limit is also applied when rolling the end}

\item{units}{Deprecated. Use elapsed dates.}

\item{vars}{Used to work around non-standard evaluation.}
